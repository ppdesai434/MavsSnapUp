# MavsSnap Up

Mavs Snap Up addresses students' issue which seems very silly at first look: "Having a reliable place to buy and sell used products which are essential for everyday use". There exist quite a few apps which offer this kind of service but the biggest concern students face is getting quality products at affordable cost and in close proximity. Since students face such issues, we believe that it will be a trustworthy system when students sell and buy items from fellow students themselves. The application lets you buy and sell preowned items quickly and locally at one click. It has numerous advantages such as making money, selling what you don’t need and find great deals nearby and cheaper as well as it is easier to spot quality. This application can be used as an android application enabling all the stated benefits to be at user’s fingertips. The application has two major types of users – UTA Students (sellers and buyers) and Admins.
